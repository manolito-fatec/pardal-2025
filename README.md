## 🎯 Objective
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The purpose of this project is to centralize and optimize a support ticket management system, ensuring greater organization, faster response times, and visibility across all levels of operations. Currently, the client faces challenges with manual ticket control using a legacy database, lack of consolidated history, and absence of performance indicators to support strategic decisions.  
>  
> With this solution, it will be possible to improve communication among teams, reduce resolution times, identify process improvement opportunities, ensure LGPD compliance in data handling, and enhance customer service quality, making the entire process more efficient, secure, and transparent.

## 📋 Requirements <a id="requirements"></a>

### 📌 Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)
| **ID** | **Title** |
| :----: | :--------- |
| NFR1   | API Documentation – Application Programming Interface |
| NFR2   | User Guide |
| NFR3   | Database Design |
| NFR4   | Non-Relational Database |
| NFR5   | LGPD Compliance |

### 📌 Functional Requirements (Epics) (FR)
| **ID** | **Role** | **Epic** | **Description** |
| :----: | :------- | :------- | :-------------- |
| FR1    | Administrator | LGPD Modernization | The system must ensure that personal and sensitive data entered in free-text fields (title, description, and ticket comments) are automatically identified and anonymized before being persisted in the database. This will require the use of regular expressions (Regex) for structured data (CPF, email, phone number) and integration with an NLP service for semantic analysis of sensitive information (health, religion, political opinion, etc.). The goal is to ensure continuous LGPD compliance and prevent improper data storage. |
| FR2    | Manager | Insights | The system must provide an analytics component that automatically generates insights about tickets, identifying recurrence patterns, critical categories, and SLA compliance. This feature aims to support strategic decision-making and improve operational efficiency. |
| FR3    | Manager | Dashboards | The system must provide managers with an interactive dashboard displaying performance indicators (KPIs), including total tickets created, average resolution time, recurrence rate, and SLA compliance. The dashboard must allow filtering by period, agent, company, category, and priority, enabling detailed and comparative analysis. |
| FR4    | Administrator | User Management | The system must provide an administrative interface that allows administrators to manage users (create, edit, deactivate, and assign roles/profiles). This ensures proper access control so that each user only views and interacts with information relevant to their responsibilities. |
| FR5    | Operator | Ticket Search | The system must provide authenticated operators with an advanced search mechanism for tickets, allowing filtering by status, category, agent, company, priority, and date range. The goal is to enable quick access to specific tickets and improve service productivity. |
